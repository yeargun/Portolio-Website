Opinions on travelling alone

I traveled to Spain and Italy between 28 March-19 March. I had a great time, met new people. Just to mention, as you know, in the 21st century, individuality has increased a lot. I'm not sure that makes much sense. I think it's cooler to be able to "devote" to your friends somewhat, and value your friendship. Life is more beautiful when you share pleasant moments with your friends. I don't know what to say as an extra, I'm just starting to write. Here are some tips then.

## Barcelona

- Visit the bench where Arda Turan sit.
- Visit hidden bars.
- Walk in the streets, parks. Streets > Sagrada Familia imo.

<hr/>

## Valencia:

- Touristic sights are lit, eat some paellas/tapas.

<hr/>

## Madrid:

- Bluesock hostels is a good place to stay.
- Is a good idea to plan what to do before you go to Madrid. There are a lot of fun events to do, you wouldnt want to miss them.

<hr/>

## Cadiz:

- Max 2 days is enough for young people. It is a small city, you can walk around the city in 1 day. It is a good place to relax.

<hr/>

## Seville:

- Don't book hostels far away from the city center.
- Visit the alcazar.
- Flamenco is a must. A little history research before visiting Seville could be a good idea.

<hr/>

## Rome:

- Don't judge Rome before seeing Spagna.
- Walking tours are actually fine, you can learn a lot of things about the city. Also there are food tasting tours, haven't tried those but probably is a good idea.
- Pizzas are actually fine.

#### Nah, I'm writing some bullshit. I'm not a travel blogger. I'm just a guy who likes to travel. (LOL This last paragraph has generated from Github copilot. Some truth with that though. I plan to write about technology in general.)
