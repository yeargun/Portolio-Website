Need for Speed Web

you will learn very little reading this article. just to know

You might find yourself doing **intensive** things with data as a software engineer. Ever wondered why do you transfer those pieces of information back and forth.

This indeed is a great question but rather in this article lets focus on the design of web as of 2023. Here are 10 worthwhile questions to think of related to web, ui, information theory, js and their respective incomplete answers. You can improve the article from [here](https://github.com/yeargun/Portolio-Website/blob/master/public/blogPosts/11122023.md)

## Why do companies serve their app through browsers for desktop users? And use pre-downloaded apps for mobile devices?
* @Web we do surfing, interact with lots of different websites that we don't care much. We retrieve information asap with state of art UIs. So web provides a just-in-time experience to PC users and doesn't enforce you to download something ahead of time.

* @Mobile, we usualy have some tools and entertainer apps installed that we are using much. Small screens, crazy bionic chips, we are not capable of doing crazy I/O with those devices and also bad internet connections doesn't help any. Yet, as of 2022, 2023 mobile phone users tend to download lesser amount of apps to their phones.(own fact checks)

## What are the fundamental differences between ahead-of-time, pre-installed softwares and just-in-time softwares?

* @just in time apps, there is/must be a big focus on hitting the network cache as ping times are a lot.
* Game developers think they are very enthusiastic, optimizing their 'to be installed' apps. Turns out, js developers are one step further **quite frankly**.

## Web, needs for speed?
Turns out thats not necessarily the case. Maintainability, good enough performance is okay in general. Yet, there indeed is a direct relationship  between page load speed metrics and conversion rates. Probably your PO knows whats up.

Now hatred against the web starts. Not that I have extensive knowledge about web but not respecting to the previous developer aligns perfectly with my fictional persona.

## HTML
Text based markup language, no one knows why its not binary. We are compressing the content before serving but still, binary is king.

## Javascript, the ecosystem and the respectful UI frameworks
I'm using React, and I am not learning another js framework. Next mainstream framework change and I'm breaking free into the wild.

People are trying to come up with better and more appropriate abstractions  to the problems, I respect that but we good my man. Whats htmx come on now. Cut the twitter memes

## WASM
good abstraction.

## Google Portable Native Client
Native Client (NaCl) is a secure sandbox for running untrusted native machine code in the Chrome browser. NaCl programs have special restrictions on the generated code, which are implemented by the compiler toolchain and statically verified at runtime by the trusted NaCl loader.

Is deprecated because
* wasn't a web standard at first place
* black boxes app some people say(isn't this a good thing)

probably not realy a valid benchmark as of 2023. Not 100% sure if pnacl is faster than wasm by nature

## JS
is good enough thanks to v8 and jscore folks.

<img src="https://yeargun.dev/assets/notFunnyNacl.png"  alt="its very not funny, I am aware">

just in time compilation, backwards compatible. different js versions, initial design was not for the web, does obey web standards and security measures.

At this point we are doing backwards compatibility, dealing with technical debts a lot. Grinds on jit etc come on now. Portable Native Client is boss, .exec is the key.

<img src="https://yeargun.dev/assets/v8JitTryhard.png"  alt="https://v8.dev/blog/maglev">

In the above image, you are seeing the v8 teams grind on executing js more efficiently.

* Ignition: js interpreter
* Sparkplug: A fast compiler
* Maglev: Mid tryhard, brand new compiler
* Turbofan: More tryhard compiler, considers runtime behaviour and much more for optimization

<img src="https://yeargun.dev/assets/joTri.png"  alt="As an engineer, you might feel the urge to make use of the triangles that you are seeing in the nature efficiently.">

You see, we are kind of stuck in this nature. CPUs not getting any better, new hardware designs etc are cool but we are stuck. The experience you got while browsing web, watching tiktoks, youtube etc. Is not native enough, look at the nature, is much *cooler* and *real time*.

Put your website some 'download button' and make it ahead-of-time ready to be served and take responsibility. What the hell is Reac Server Components. Lame as hell

Thanks for reading, web is big but newcomers should be disrespectful and assume all pre-written codes and systems are inefficient. Never assume you are standing on the shoulders of giants. 

Don't ever fall into the fallacy of abstraction, prefer starting from scratch and grow through difficulty. Embrace nonabstraction.

Got me wondering, what are your opinions.. I had none writing this article.

please dont take it all seriously.

## Bonus: Lossless compression and Web
as an aditional hate speech, I respect very little to gzip and brotli with no deep dive research.[https://www.mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html](https://www.mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html)


Not that I believe my points are extremely valid. People probably had their reasons, whatever.
