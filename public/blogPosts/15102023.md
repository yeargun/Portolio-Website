Hate Speech on Just-In-Time Compilation | JS runtimes for web

I've been doing research over this topic for the last 2 weeks. The inefficiency is annoying. Yes we are not doing rocket science, web is mid anyways but is that okay?

I mean, the grind is lot. SSC, SSR, bundlers and stuff. But the foundation is mediocre at best? Or my knowledge is very limited.

Things that I consider as inefficient:

- JIT/JS. Jit the f\*:

  - get index.html (HEADER: runtime environment specific infos)
  - res -> html_css_manipulator.EXECUTABLE
  - not that we should stop using js and/or jit or something. Just having this freedom could be cool. Some apps could make use of it.
  - Having heard, dynamicity of the js is very essential and the web is designed based on that(the security standards, the other stuff..). Damn redesign than.
  - ...

- HTML/CSS:
  - Okay CSS is very complex. I am nowhere close to knowing how it works under the hood.
  - HTML, is it an efficient Markup Language? Why arent we serving binary markup languages? Gzip, encode/decode etc is also mid. Human is mid im okay with that by the way.

Lets be **real**, I know of very **little** about the details, web is very **big. Yet its known that we do big mediocrity to provide backwards compatibility for this web thing.** Open invitation from starting from scratch.

just scribbling but

Got me wondering, what kind of design decisions we would make if we could start from scratch.
