Hate Speech on Just-In-Time Compilation | JS runtimes for web

I've been doing research on: js just in time compilation, js runtime environments, binary markup languages, etc. for the last 2 weeks. The inefficiency is annoying. Yes we are not doing rocket science, web is mid anyways but is that okay?

I mean, the grind on some aspects are lot. SSC, SSR, bundlers and stuff. But the foundation for the web is mediocre at best? Or my knowledge is very limited.

Some things that I consider as inefficient that hit my mind right now:

- JIT/JS. Jit the f\*:

  - get index.html (HEADER: runtime environment specific infos)
  - res -> html_css_manipulator.EXECUTABLE
  - not that we should stop using js and/or jit or something. Just having this freedom could be cool. Some apps could make use of it.
  - Having heard, dynamicity of the js is very essential and the web is designed based on that(the security standards, the other stuff..). Damn redesign then.
  - ...

- HTML/CSS:
  - Okay CSS is very complex. I am nowhere close to knowing how it works under the hood.
  - HTML, is it an efficient Markup Language? Why arent we serving binary markup languages? Gzip, encode/decode etc is also mid. Human is mid im okay with that by the way.

Lets be **real**, I know of very **little** about the details, web is very **big. Yet its known that we do big mediocrity to provide backwards compatibility for this web thing.** Open invitation for starting from scratch.

just scribbling but

Got me wondering, what kind of design decisions we would make if we could start from scratch.
